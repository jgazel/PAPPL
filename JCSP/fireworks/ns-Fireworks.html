<P>Point at the applet and [LEFT-MOUSE-CLICK] for a quick burst of sparks.
Hold the [LEFT-MOUSE-BUTTON] down for a burst that continues whilst holding -
drag the mouse and the fireworks will follow.  [RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK] to keep
the show going without holding the button down - [RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK] again
to cancel.  Whilst in the [RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK] mode, [LEFT-MOUSE-BUTTON] and
drag repositions the show.  Note: you can drag the firework launch point off
the applet panel in any direction.  Freeze the action with [MIDDLE-MOUSE-CLICK]
- unfreeze the same way.

<P>Keyboard controls (use whilst in continuous show mode to see the effects):
<UL>
  <LI>
    'C'/'c' - narrows/broadens (respectively) the launch cone of the firework.
    Pushing 'C' to its maximum produces a <i>Roman Candle</i>.  Pushing 'c' to its
    minimum yields a <i>sparkler</i> (sparks flying in all directions with equal
    probability);
  <LI>
    'L'/'l' - increases/decreases (respectively) the spark launch velocity.
    Warning: there is no maximum imposed!  Very large velocities produce a <i>laser</i>
    show.
  <LI>
    'P'/'p' - increases/decreases (respectively) the number of particles launched per second.
    Warning: there is no maximum imposed!  However, an applet parameter restricts
    the total number of particles being animated (the default maximum is 15000).
    If more than that number become visible, the oldest ones are discarded.
  <LI>
    'S'/'s' - increases/decreases (respectively) the scale of the display.  Pushing 's'
    to its minimum enables <i>sky writing</i> by dragging with the [LEFT-MOUSE-BUTTON].
    Try doing this with the 'c'one control pushed to minimum and increase the 'L'aunch
    velocity increased to around 30,000 ...
